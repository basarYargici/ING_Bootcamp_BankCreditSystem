• The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID,
initialCredit).

• Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID is
customerID.

• Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.

• Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and
transactions of the accounts.

There are 2 ways of run & build the application.

#### Docker Compose

For docker compose usage, docker images already push to docker.io

You just need to run `docker-compose up` command
___
*$PORT: 8080*
```ssh
$ cd account
$ docker-compose up


#### Maven

For maven usage, you need to change `proxy` value in the `account-fe/package.json` 
file by `"http://localhost:8080"` due to the default value has been settled for docker image network proxy.
